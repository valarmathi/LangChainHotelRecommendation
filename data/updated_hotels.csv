æ If you want sumptuous food for less price, you have to be here. They have spacious ambience. Good service. We had ordered for a Empire special chicken Kabab and chicken chilli among starters, both were very tasty, chicken chilly was a Lil spicy.

For main course we had Ceylon parotta and their special boneless butter chicken, the parotta was soft and good. The butter chicken was filled with boneless chicken pieces which was soft and tender.

Then we had ordered for Half ghee rice and half biryani rice, this is one of their best thing where we can even order half portions when we want to try both the dishes. We love the ghee rice there. Ghee rice and butter chicken combination here is the best, this taste cannot be found elsewhere.
The biryani rice was OK this time, thought we should have ordered the ghee rice instead. Overall nice food with good portions.

It was nice but what I loved most was their combos (good in quality and quantity for a dinner). we ordered box 18 (veg gobi manchurian ,kadhai paneer,ghee rice),box 20 (chicken biryani boneless,popcorn kebab and raita) and box 23 (ghee rice,paneer butter masala and gobi manchurian again). these were so delicious in taste, you should try these if you are looking for daily food. I specially liked the ghee rice .

The packaging is perhaps one of the best. Loved the personalized containers and neat labeling.

An old restaurant called The Ants cafe existed here before them & their branding wasn't taken off. It's a sprawling garden mansion with garden seating & Christmas decor to match the occasion. We didn't find any crepes in the menu even though their name bore Crepe. So it was expected that they should specialise in crepe. Anyhow, we settled for common breakfast items like a masala omlette that was served with toast & a chicken sandwich that was served with fries. We also ordered a plate of potato wedges & a masala tea & hot chocolate. The idea was to pair the wedges with the omlette. But wedges came first, followed by sandwich & tea & omlette & hot chocolate the last. The serving guy looked confused & even though it was pretty empty, the wait time was high.

Value for Money: 3/5

Couple of friends and i went to Boondook Bistro. Its located on the 3rd floor next to Forum Whitefield. We started with couple of starters which were reasonably priced but what we got was not worth it. We ordered Honey chilli potato which were raw, tasteless and with zero hint of honey. Then comes the fries with jalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±os. There were close to about 1 teaspoon of chopped jalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±os drizzed on top of it. But the taste was okay. Later i ordered Main course that is Chicken Steak which was served with cold mash potato, raw veggies and the chicken was black in colour. The cooks grilled the chicken for so long that it burned and had a smell of it. Only good thing i liked was the sauce served on top of it. Overall bad experience. Will not be recommending this place.'), ('Rated 4.0', ""RATED
æ Visited this place for Sunday lunch. Less parking space, even for a 2 wheeler. Located on the topmost floor.
Place was not really crowded. 
Loved the ambiance. It overlooks the busy Main Road on one side and peaceful villas on the other. 

Honey Garlic Korean Shrimps was simply amazing. The sauce was to die for. Spicy Chicken Wings and Pollo Champagne were both good.

Service was excellent. Food was served quite late though. Pricing was reasonable. Would like to try out other dishes next time around.

Update: Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Very less crowd. 
Crunchy Honey Garlic Prawns was quite tasty. 
Boonies Farmhouse Chicken Burger wasn't too great. The double patty wasn't too appetising.
The Kingston Steak was also average.
Service was still excellent.""), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED
æ Located in the right place. Wanted to try out their 4-course meal where soup, starter and dessert are decided by them and we get to choose main course. We chose one veg and non veg meal.

Veg clear soup was okiesh and chicken clear soup was good.

Starters were perfect with 3 varieties and cabbage salad to compliment the starters.

Main course: It was my personal favorite. They are best in what they serve.

Dessert: Brownie with ice cream. Idk if I could ask for it to be better.'), ('Rated 2.0', 'RATED

æ Visited Boondock after two years.
The size has reduced from ginormous to perfect in portion (on the plate).

I love everything they have to offer on their menu. Everything is jam packed with flavour. We had ordered bacon cheesy fries. It was great.
My all time favorite here is the prawns wrapped in bacon. Highly recommend it.
