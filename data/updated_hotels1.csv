æ Had been on a week night for an authentic south Indian food. I personally love being served on banyan leaf. The waiters are all dressed up in traditional Mysore attire wearing with a peta. The food was delicious and definitely worth it's price. The waiters are friendly and serve u well with a smile.

Note: (It happen with us)
 - If you going TWO people, you may need to share the table there. Its almost crowed.
 - You have to sit where they ask, you can't choose even if all the table are empty.
